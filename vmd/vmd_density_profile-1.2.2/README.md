VMD Density Profile Tool
========================================


The Density Profile Tool is a VMD [1] analysis plugin that computes
1-D projections of various atomic densities. The computation may be
performed in a single frame, a trajectory, or averaged over multiple
frames.

 *  Number density, i.e. average number of atoms per unit volume
 *  Mass density
 *  Charge density
 *  Electron density, i.e. average number of electrons.

Quickstart
----------------------------------------

Once correctly installed, a menu item should appear in VMD's
Extensions menu, under "Extensions>Analysis>Density Profile Tool".

The plugin can be used interactively or via a scripting interface. See
the included test script (example.tcl) for an example of in-script
usage. The script 

1. loads Klauda's equilibrated membranes
   (http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jbklauda/research/download.html), POPC
   Bilayer (303.00K, NPT, 35ns, 72 lipids);
2. computes the mass density profile for water molecules, showing
   it as a table and a plot;
3. computes the electron density profile for the whole system, showing
   it as a plot.

Sample output for point 2.:
